Not everything works:
- testbss: zeroing out the bss still missing, rest of file works
  		   you can comment out the zero check in user/testbss.c and it will work

- mapunmap / vmaspace: both crash on a page fault in user space with wrong permissions
                       dont know yet what the cause of this is
