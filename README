LAB 7
Kernel Programming 2018 @VU
by Matthijs Jansen and Zuzana Hromcova
Version from Tuesday, October

No bonus implemented
Score:
    - Lab 5 fork doesnt work so cowfork and mcorefork do not work
    - make run-qemu CPUS=X with X>1 can be used to test multicore
    - In main.c, a couple of different environments are created (7 in total) with which a multicore setting can be simulated
    - These ENV_CREATE(...) statements can be changed so different core and env settings can be tested (1 cpu, >1 envs OR >1cpu, 1 env etc).
    - LAB 7: This version is slower than the lab 6 version because of added datastructures needed for swapping. The user program to test lab 7, mempress is also very big so it will take a lot of time to complete, which means it will time-out when using make grade. However when running make run-mempress-nox CPUS=1 or an equivalent call, it will complete after some time. Using an intel i5-3570k processor running Ubuntu 18.04 in a VM with the cpu capped at 70%, it took a bit more than 7 minutes to complete

See the pdf for more explanation about this lab.
Most of the lab 7 code can be found in kern/swap.c
